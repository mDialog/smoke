Smoke
======

*Simple, asynchronous HTTP powered by [Akka](http://akka.io)*

A thin DSL for building simple, fast, scalable, asynchronous HTTP services with Scala.

## Using

In your build.sbt

    resolvers += "mDialog releases" at "http://mdialog.github.com/releases/"

    libraryDependencies += "com.mdialog" %% "smoke" % "0.6.0"

Smoke 0.6.0 is made for use with Scala 2.10 and Akka 2.2. If you're using an older
version of Scala, consider Smoke [0.3.0](https://github.com/mDialog/smoke/tree/5a0038099ff67113234fb8342a7328df6be1e9e4). 

## Getting started

Build a simple application

    import smoke._

    object BasicExampleApp extends Smoke {
      onRequest {
        case GET(Path("/example")) => reply {
          Thread.sleep(1000)
          Response(Ok, body="It took me a second to build this response.\n")
        }
        case _ => reply(Response(NotFound))
      }
    }

Run it with sbt

    sbt run

Smoke provides a DSL for building HTTP services using a simple request/response pattern, where each response is provided as an Akka Future. Akka provides a powerful toolkit to control the creation and execution of Futures; spend some time with that project's [excellent documentation](http://akka.io/docs) to get a feel for how it works.

With the Smoke trait, you get access to the tools necessary to build a robust Akka-based application. That includes to an `ActorSystem`, `Dispatcher`, default timeout and `Config` object.

    trait Smoke {
      final implicit val config = configure()
      final implicit val system = ActorSystem("Smoke", config)
      final implicit val dispatcher = system.dispatcher
      final implicit val timeout = Timeout(timeoutDuration milliseconds)
      ...
    }


Be sure to check out the  [examples](https://github.com/mDialog/smoke/tree/master/src/main/scala/smoke/examples).

## The Responder

The heart of any Smoke app is the responder function. Set it by supplying a function that accepts a `Request` and returns a `Future[Response]` to the `onRequest` method.

    onRequest {
      case GET(Path("/example")) => Future {
        Thread.sleep(1000)
        Response(Ok, body="It took me a second to build this response.\n")
      }
      case _ => reply(Response(NotFound))
    }

Smoke also provides a simple collection of request extractors based on the familiar set found in projects like [Play2 Mini](https://github.com/typesafehub/play2-mini) and [Unfiltered](http://unfiltered.databinder.net/Unfiltered.html). These can be used for pattern matching on `Request` objects.

    case GET(Path(Seg("resources" :: id :: Nil))) => ...
    case POST(Path("/resources")) & Params(p) => ...

To respond, you can use the `reply` method. Supply a function that returns a Response and it will be wrapped in a Future for you.

    case GET(Path("/example")) => reply {
      Thread.sleep(1000)
      Response(Ok, body="It took me a second.\n")
    }

If your request can be responded to quickly and immediately, you can pass a `Response` directly and it will be wrapped in a completed `Future`.

    case _ => reply(Response(NotFound))

Since a reply is just a Future[Response], you can also get one from an actor.

    class Responder extends Actor {
      def receive = {
        case GET(Path("/example")) =>
          Thread.sleep(1000)
          sender ! Response(Ok, body="It took me a second.\n")
        case _ => sender ! Response(NotFound)
      }
    }

    object ActorExampleApp extends Smoke {
      val actor = system.actorOf(Props[Responder])

      onRequest (actor ? _ mapTo manifest[Response])
    }

Even better, you can use the tools provided by Akka to compose your responder function using many Futures:

    class DataSource extends Actor {
      def receive = {
        case _ => sender ! "Some data"
      }
    }

    class ResponseBuilder extends Actor {
      def receive = {
        case s: String => sender ! ("Found: " + s)
      }
    }

    object ChainedActorExampleApp extends Smoke {
      val dataSource = system.actorOf(Props[DataSource])
      val builder = system.actorOf(Props[ResponseBuilder])

      onRequest { request =>
        for {
          data <- dataSource ? request
          response <- builder ? data mapTo manifest[String]
        } yield Response(Ok, body = response)
      }
    }

To get a feel for the power of Scala's composable futures, [read the documentation](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/snapshot/scala/futures.html).

### Responses

Responses are built using three parameters: a status code object, a `Seq[(String,String)]` of headers and a request body.

    Response(Ok, Seq(("Location", resource.location)), resource.toJson)

## Before/After filters

You can use the `before` and `after` filters to alter either the request prior to sending it to the responder or the response after it's been returned.

    after { resp =>
      val headers = resp.headers + ("Server" -> "ExampleApp/0.0.1")
      Response(resp.status, headers, resp.body)
    }

## Error handling

If your `Future[Response]` contains an exception, you can catch it and return an alternate response using the `onError` method. Any uncaught exceptions will return a 500.

	onRequest {
	  case _ => fail(NotFoundException)
	}

	onError {
	  case NotFoundException => Response(NotFound)
	}

This is especially useful when using a responder function composed from several Futures.

## Basically,

    def application = before andThen onRequest andThen { f =>
      f recover(onError) map after
    }

*(paraphrased)*

## Graceful shutdown

Smoke will shutdown the server and `ActorSystem` when the process receives a `TERM` signal, from Ctrl-C or `kill <pid>` for instance. You can attach shutdown hooks both before and after this shutdown occurs.

    beforeShutdown {
      println("Getting ready to shutdown")
    }

    afterShutdown {
      println("No longer responding to requests.")
    }

## SSL and Client Certificates

Smoke supports SSL, including optional use of client certificates. See the configuration section for more information.

## Configuration

There are a few of configuration options. Like Akka, Smoke uses [Typesafe Config Library](https://github.com/typesafehub/config). You can override any of the default configuration options by adding an `application.conf` file to your project.

    smoke {
      timeout = 2s

      log-type = "stdout" # alternatively, set to "file"
      log-file = "access.log" # if log-type is "file"

      error-log-type = "stdout" # alternatively, set to "file"
      error-log-file = "error.log" # used if log-type set to "file"
      error-log-verbose = false

      http {
        #Multiple ports may be used by specifying more than one port in this list
        ports = [7771]
      }

      https {

        #Multiple ports may be used by specifying a list, overriding the port setting
        #(Set empty to disable http)
        ports = []

        # Server Authentication

        # The location of the jks format key store to be used
        # If not provided, the system property javax.net.ssl.keyStore is used
        ##key-store = "test.jks"

        # The password for the key store.
        # If not provided, the system property javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword is used
        ##key-store-password = "test-password"

        # Client Authentication

        # Set to true to enable SSL client certificates (2 way handshake)
        use-client-auth = false

        # The location of the jks format trust store to be used
        # If not provided, the system property javax.net.ssl.trustStore is used
        ##trust-store = "test.jks"

        # The password for the trust store.
        # If not provided, the system property javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword is used
        ##trust-store-password = "test-password"
      }
    }

For more control over how the the config object is constructed, you
may override the Smoke configure() method. For example, to include
extra config from a properties file, you would do the following:

    override def configure() = {
      ConfigFactory.parseResources("configuration.properties")
        .withFallback(ConfigFactory.load())
    }

## Try it out

Clone the repository, run one of the sample apps:

    sbt run

Make requests:

    curl -i http://localhost:7771/example

## Testing

Unit testing components of your application that interact with Smoke is made easier using the provided TestRequest class, which inherits from the Request trait.

    case class TestRequest(uriString: String,
                           method: String = "GET",
                           headers: Map[String, String] = Map.empty,
                           body: String = "",
                           keepAlive: Boolean = true) extends Request


Using this class along with the tools provided by Akka allows testing of your application's responder function.

You can test an app by initializing and shutting it down inside a test suite. Invoke the application method directly, passing it a TestRequest.

    import org.scalatest.{ FunSpec, BeforeAndAfterAll }

    import scala.concurrent.Await
    import scala.concurrent.duration._

    import smoke._
    import smoke.test._

    class BasicExampleAppTest extends FunSpec with BeforeAndAfterAll {
  
      val app = BasicExampleApp
  
      override def beforeAll { app.init() }
      override def afterAll { app.shutdown() }  
  
      describe("GET /example") {    
        it("should respond with 200") {
          val request = TestRequest("/example")
          val response = Await.result(app.application(request), 2 seconds)
          assert(response.status === Ok)
        }
      }
  
      describe("POST /unknown-path") {
        it("should respond with 404") {
          val request = TestRequest("/unknown-path", "POST")
          val response = Await.result(app.application(request), 2 seconds)
          assert(response.status === NotFound)
        }
      }
    }

This is the same way Smoke processes requests while your app is running.
